                Hello! My name is Grace Casale and I am passionate about connecting with others to exchange ideas and
                perspectives.
                I enjoy solving problems through solutions-oriented thinking.
                From team-management and leadership with educators in my previous career,
                to analyzing and writing code as a developer, I value the process of continuous learning.
                I am seeking a position as a web developer that will allow me to collaborate with others and promotes
                professional growth. In my role as a Software Engineer with Mindtree, I am currently preparing for a role as a 
                Salesforce Administrator. I am eager to contribute and apply all the amazing features of
                Salesforce Lightning and Classic to help support an organization with their CRM, Sales, Marketing - you name it! 
            </p>
            <p class="statement-index d-flex justify-content-center text-center">
                I began my professional career in the field of public education as a classroom teacher and later an Assistant Principal.
                I was driven by the spirit of service while working with students, families, and staff.
                At the same time, I was curious about the ever-changing ways to integrate technology into instruction.
                From SmartBoards to Google Classroom and eventually designing yearlong computer-based curricula,
                technology in education became a focal point in my pedagogy.
                I volunteered to be the Site Technology Coordinator and even led a free evening course in Google Apps
                for my Native-Spanish-speaking families who had never written an email.
                Over time, my interest in coding heightened as I contributed to my schoolâ€™s webpage, social media, and
                digital marketing newsletters.
                I began studying SQL in 2017 but quickly found a love for HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p class="statement-index d-flex justify-content-center text-center">
                In 2018 I enrolled in a 12 week web development immersive program focusing on the MERN stack in
                Gainesville, FL. In January 2019 I joined the Mindtree family as a Software Engineer. Although my original focus
                was in Java full-stack development, I found an interest in the company's Salesforce practice. I am currently seeking a position 
                in Portland, OR where I can contribute to an organization's Salesforce platform or through front end development.
