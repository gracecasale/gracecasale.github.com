                Hello! My name is Grace Casale and I am passionate about connecting with others to exchange ideas and
                perspectives.
                I enjoy solving problems through solutions-oriented thinking.
                From team-management and leadership with educators in my previous career,
                to analyzing and writing code as a developer, I value the process of continuous learning.
                I am seeking a position as a web developer that will allow me to collaborate with others and promotes
                professional growth.
            </p>
            <p class="statement-index d-flex justify-content-center text-center">
                For the last decade I worked in the field of public education as a classroom teacher and most recently
                an Assistant Principal.
                I was driven by the spirit of service while working with students, families, and staff.
                At the same time, I was curious about the ever-changing ways to integrate technology into instruction.
                From SmartBoards to Google Classroom and eventually designing yearlong computer-based curricula,
                technology in education became a focal point in my pedagogy.
                I volunteered to be the Site Technology Coordinator and even led a free evening course in Google Apps
                for my Native-Spanish-speaking families who had never written an email.
                Over time, my interest in coding heightened as I contributed to my schoolâ€™s webpage, social media, and
                digital marketing newsletters.
                I began studying SQL in 2017 but quickly found a love for HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p class="statement-index d-flex justify-content-center text-center">
                At this point in my career I am making a transition to expand my new passion while still applying the
                skills I refined as an educator and leader.
                I am currently enrolled in a 12 week web development immersive focusing on the MERN stack in
                Gainesville, FL. I am excited to find a new career in programming and continuing to collaborate and
                serving others.
